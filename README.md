### Sample code from the SDSS-ALMA Legacy-Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE) project ###

SALVAGE aims to assemble a complete sampling of SDSS targets observed by ALMA with frequency coverage of the CO(1-0) line and a resolution of less than 3" with which we can understand the cold gas properties of a large sampling of galaxies on a semi-resolved scale. 

We adapt the PHANGS-ALMA reduction pipeline for the purposes of automating the imaging process for our ~300 SDSS targets.
